<h1>Fundamental of Design Systems</h1> 

## **What is a Design System?**
---

**A design system is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and principles that define how a product or brand should look and behave.** It serves as a centralized source of truth for design decisions, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the development process.

**Key components of a design system typically include:**

* **Atomic design:** A methodology for breaking down UI into smaller, reusable components (atoms, molecules, organisms).
* **Style guide:** A set of rules governing typography, color, spacing, and other visual elements.
* **Component library:** A collection of pre-built, reusable UI components.
* **Pattern library:** Examples of how components can be combined to create different UI patterns.

## **Design System Pillars:**

---

1. **Design Language** 
   - **Color Palettes**: Defines primary, secondary, and neutral colors.
   - **Typography**: Specifies font families, sizes, weights, and styles.
   - **Icons**: Establishes a consistent set of icons.

2. **UI Kit** üõ†Ô∏è
   - **Components**: Includes buttons, forms, modals, etc.
   - **Layout Grids**: Provides structure for spacing and alignment.
   - **Figma/Sketch**: Tools for prototyping and design collaboration.

3. **Component Library** 
   - **React/Angular/Vue**: Libraries of reusable components.
   - **Styled Components**: Ensures consistent styling across the app.
   - **Testing**: Ensures components work correctly in different scenarios.

4. **Style Guide** 
   - **Documentation**: Detailed guidelines and examples for usage.
   - **Storybook**: Interactive environment to develop and test components.
   - **Gatsby.js**: For building and deploying style guides and documentation sites.

#### 1. Accessibility
- **Color Contrast Ratios:** Design systems make sure that applications have enough colors with proper contrast ratios.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensures different parts of the application can be accessed with keyboards.
- **Screen Readers:** Important alerts are detected by screen readers for users who need them.

#### 2. Consistency
- **Unified Experience:** Ensures that all products from a company look and feel like they come from the same family. A common example is Google‚Äôs suite of products like Google Drive and Maps, which share the same web components and styles.
- **Brand Showcase:** All products should showcase the brand of the company. Consistency is a primary focus of design systems.

#### 3. Cascading Updates
- **Gradual Updates:** Enables little by little updates without micro-managing each change.
- **Cross-Team Communication:** Streamlines communication by updating the entire design system with a single click, eliminating the need to individually notify each concern team.

#### 4. Onboarding New Members
- **Central Style Guide:** Provides a one-stop shop for new developers to find the information they need to start working on the project right away.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Ensures all teams use the same system. This allows developers to easily assist other teams because they are familiar with the design system.


### Efficiency and Speed

- **Prototyping:** Designers can use the UI kit to quickly prototype new components.
- **Component Library:** Developers can use the component library to develop new components swiftly since the design and components are pre-developed.
  
Once a design system is in place and stable, both designers and developers can work more efficiently, delivering new features quickly by just consuming and showcasing pre-developed and designed components.


## **Drawback of building Design System**
---

**1. Time and Resource Investment** 
- Takes years to build.
- Companies value this seriously.

**2. Team Structure** 
- Essential to have the right team.

**5. Adaptation Challenge** 
- Main issue is ensuring teams adopt the system.
- Proper team structure helps in tackling this.


## **Design System Team Structure**

---

- Centralized team: A single team responsible for everything, including building and maintaining the system, defining the foundations, developing the component library and style guides, and ensuring consistency across all products.
- Distributed team: Each product team is responsible for developing and maintaining their own version of the system, with some level of coordination and shared components.
- Hybrid team: A combination of centralized and distributed teams, with a core team responsible for the overall system and individual product teams contributing and customizing it.

**Benefits and drawbacks of each model**

- Centralized team:
    - Ensures consistency and quality across all products.
    - Provides faster development and delivery.
    - May lead to slower adoption by product teams if they feel they have little control over the system.
- Distributed team:
    - Increases adoption and ownership by product teams.
    - Promotes innovation and new ideas.
    - May lead to inconsistencies and fragmentation across products.
- Hybrid team:
    - Combines the benefits of centralized and distributed teams.
    - Provides faster development and delivery while still allowing for innovation and customization.
    - Requires more coordination and effort to manage.

Ultimately, the best team structure for your organization will depend on your specific needs and goals. Consider the size and complexity of your products, the level of collaboration between teams, and the importance of consistency and innovation.

**Additional points to consider:**

- Team composition: The team should include designers, engineers, product managers, and other relevant stakeholders.
- Communication and collaboration: Clear communication and collaboration are essential for the success of any design system team.
- Documentation and training: Good documentation and training materials are essential for helping people understand and use the design system.
- Governance: A governance process should be in place to ensure that the design system is evolving in a way that meets the needs of all stakeholders.
