## **What is a Design System?** 🎨

A **design system** is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and principles that define how a product or brand should look and behave. It serves as a centralized source of truth for design decisions, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the development process.

### Key Components:
* **Atomic Design:** Breaking down UI into smaller, reusable components (atoms, molecules, organisms).
* **Style Guide:** Rules governing typography, color, spacing, and other visual elements.
* **Component Library:** Collection of pre-built, reusable UI components.
* **Pattern Library:** Examples of how components can be combined to create different UI patterns.

### Popular Design Systems:
1. Google — Material Design System
2. Atlassian Design System
3. Microsoft — Fluent Design System
4. IBM Carbon Design System
5. Apple Human Interface Guidelines
6. Airbnb Design System
7. Uber Design System
